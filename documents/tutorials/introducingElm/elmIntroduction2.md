# Functions, functions, functions

Elm code is organised into _functions_ that evaluate expressions to produce some value. Those functions may have some input in the form of _parameters_ and they will always return some output. Functions never change existing values and their returned value is always the only thing they return. In other words, functions in Elm never have any _side effects_. Almost everything in an Elm program will be a function. Elm doesn't use 'variables' common in many other languages. Instead, you create simple named functions that return a value.

You declare a function by giving it a name of your choice in 'lowerCamelCase' and some expression that provides a value. In litvis you must give every top-level function a _type annotation_ that describes the types of value that the function handles.

Here are some examples

```elm {l}
myFunction : String
myFunction =
    "Hello, world"


anotherFunction : Int
anotherFunction =
    49


magicLetter : Char
magicLetter =
    'g'


showPicture : Bool
showPicture =
    False
```

The first line of each of these function declarations is a type annotation with the name of the function to the left of the colon and the type of value returned by the function on the right.

Unlike 'variables', in Elm all values are _immutable_ – once `magicLetter` has been assigned the value `'g'` it cannot be assigned any other value within the lifetime of the program.

You may be wondering how we can write useful programs if all assignments are immutable. The answer is that we can also provide _parameters_ to functions that allow the returned values to be customised depending on the parameter values.

Here's a function to add two numbers together:

```elm {l}
add : Int -> Int -> Int
add firstNumber secondNumber =
    firstNumber + secondNumber
```

And here it is being used in another function:

```elm {l raw}
mySum : Int
mySum =
    add 5 12
```

Notice how the type annotation for `add` contains three types separated by `->` arrows. The first two refer to the types of two parameters and the last one the type of value returned. Note also that unlike some other languages, the parameters are simply separated by spaces with no brackets or commas used.

Even operators such as `+`, `-`, `*` are functions. In their common form, as used in the example above, they are known as _infix operators_ because they sit in an expression with one parameter to the operator's left and one to the right. By placing such operators inside brackets, they become _prefix operators_ with their parameters following the operator just like your own functions. The following functions are equivalent to each other:

```elm {l raw}
subtractInfix : Float
subtractInfix =
    150 - 13


subtractPrefix : Float
subtractPrefix =
    (-) 150 13
```

We will see a use for the prefix operator form when we consider [list processing](elmIntroduction4.md) in a later chapter.

The expressions evaluated in a function can contain a mix of operators and other functions:

```elm {l}
multiply : Int -> Int -> Int
multiply n1 n2 =
    n1 * n2


divide : Int -> Int -> Int
divide denominator numerator =
    if denominator == 0 then
        0

    else
        numerator // denominator


double : Int -> Int
double n =
    multiply 2 n


isOdd : Int -> Bool
isOdd n =
    modBy 2 n == 1


sumIsOdd : Int -> Int -> Bool
sumIsOdd n1 n2 =
    isOdd (add n1 n2)
```

```elm {l raw}
myAnswer : Bool
myAnswer =
    sumIsOdd 5 12
```

In the `divide` function above we use a conditional expression (`if`...`then`...`else`) to ensure we do not perform a divide by zero. Unlike some other languages, `if` must always be paired with an `else` because we must guarantee a value is returned whatever the value of the condition. Note also that Elm has a special operator for integer division (e.g. `6 // 2`) to distinguish it from floating point division (e.g. `6.3 / 2.0`).

## Brackets, precedence and pipes

In the function `sumIsOdd` we have used brackets to force `add n1 n2` to be evaluated before its value is supplied as an argument to `isOdd`. This is necessary because without brackets, the expression `isOdd add n1 n2` would be treated as a call to `isOdd` providing 3 arguments `add`, `n1` and `n2`.

An alternative to using brackets is to force the order of evaluation with the pipe operators `<|` and `|>`, where the part of the expression at the wide end of the triangle is evaluated before the part at the pointy end. For example, the following is exactly equivalent to `sumIsOdd`:

```elm {l}
sumIsOdd2 : Int -> Int -> Bool
sumIsOdd2 n1 n2 =
    isOdd <| add n1 n2
```

The value of this form of expression becomes more obvious when we use the `|>` operator in more complex expressions to representing the 'piping' of the output of one evaluated expression into the input of another.

Consider the coding of the following party trick:

> _Think of a number.
> Double it.
> Multiply that number by five.
> Now divide it by the number you first thought of.
> And finally, subtract seven from the number and write it down._
>
> _The number written on the paper is ... 3. Ta dah!_

```elm {l}
always3 : Int -> Int
always3 n =
    double n |> multiply 5 |> divide n |> add -7
```

```elm {l raw siding}
partyTrick : Int
partyTrick =
    always3 146470
```

The equivalent of the expression in `always3` using brackets requires us to nest brackets to control the order of evaluation, appearing in the 'wrong' order when read left to right, making it more difficult to read:

```elm {l siding}
always3Backwards : Int -> Int
always3Backwards n =
    add -7 (divide n (multiply 5 (double n)))
```

Often it is clearer to use the pipe operator to chain a sequence of functions together in the natural order we would process them. A variation of this is used commonly in _elm-vegalite_ when creating visualization specifications (see _functional composition_ below for more details).

## Scoping expressions with 'let'

By default, once a function has been declared it is available to any other parts of your program. In a litvis document that means any non-isolated code block within the document including any upstream branches connected with `follows`. Sometimes a function may only have relevance within a small section of your code, so it is helpful to be able to limit its scope. This is done by declaring a function with `let..in` within the body of another function. Any function declared in this way is only usable within the expression following the `in`.

```elm {l raw siding}
result : Int
result =
    let
        square x =
            x * x
    in
    square 32
```

Unlike top-level function definitions, locally scoped functions do not need to have a type annotation, although this always remains an option.

## Anonymous Functions

Sometimes it is a little cumbersome to create a new named function with its own type annotation, especially if that function is simple or is to be used only once. A more compact alternative is to create an anonymous function (sometimes referred to as a _lambda expression_).

Here's a named function that contains an anonymous function for finding the square a number:

```elm {l raw siding}
result : Int
result =
    (\x -> x * x) 32
```

Anonymous functions are enclosed in brackets with their parameters named after a `\` symbol (representing lambda, the Greek letter λ) and the returned value after an `->` arrow. One of the main uses of anonymous functions is when _folding_ and _mapping_ lists of items (see [lists and list processing](elmIntroduction4.md)).

## Partial application and currying

The value returned by a function can be anything, including another function. So both of the following are valid functions:

```elm {l}
betterDivide : Int -> Int -> Int
betterDivide n1 n2 =
    divide n2 n1


anotherDivide : Int -> Int -> Int
anotherDivide =
    divide
```

The first case (`betterDivide`) calls an existing function (`divide`) but reverses the order of parameters. In the second case (`anotherDivide`) notice how the type annotation also expects two `Int` parameters and returns an `Int` but we do not name those parameters in the body of the function. It does this by returning another function (`divide`) with the same type signature. It is common in functional programming to create functions that themselves return functions. In fact this is what happens in every single function that has more then one parameter...

Did you notice anything odd about the pipeline expression used in `always3` above?

The function `multiply` takes two parameters and yet when we called it, we only appeared to provide one (`multiply 5`). Providing only a subset of the parameters of function is known as _partial application_ and the returned result is itself a function with the remaining unspecified parameters. For example, we could create a new function that returned a function that multiplies any number by 5:

```elm {l raw}
multByFive : Int -> Int
multByFive =
    multiply 5


myResult : Int
myResult =
    multByFive 10
```

Something similar happens in any function that contains several parameters.
Consider the type annotation of `multiply`:

```elm
multiply : Int -> Int -> Int
```

This returns a function that if given just a single `Int` will return a new function that itself requires an `Int` as a parameter, equivalent to

```elm
multiply : Int -> (Int -> Int)
```

And if an integer is provided to _that_ function, it will return a simple `Int` (which is what `myResult` did above).

This process of sequentially processing partially applied functions is known as [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) and helps to explain why the symbol `->` is used to separate parameters and the returned value in a type annotation.

A function with four parameters is actually a function with just one parameter that returns a function with three parameters, which is itself a function with one parameter that returns a function with two parameters, which is itself another function with one parameter that returns a function with one parameter that evaluates an expression to return a value. Phew! Reading the `->` arrows is probably simpler!

## Functional Composition

The final concept we will consider here relevant to handling functions is the process of combining functions through _functional composition_.

Suppose we wished to create a function that given a number will return the cube of that number plus six. And for the purposes of this illustration we only had access to these two functions:

```elm {l}
cube : Float -> Float
cube n =
    n ^ 3


plusSix : Float -> Float
plusSix n =
    n + 6
```

We could use the pipe operator to call both functions in order to evaluate an answer:

```elm {l raw siding}
combined : Float -> Float
combined n =
    cube n |> plusSix


answer : Float
answer =
    combined 10
```

Alternatively we can use functional compositon to create a single new function that combines the two others:

```elm {l raw siding}
combined : Float -> Float
combined =
    cube >> plusSix


answer : Float
answer =
    combined 10
```

This alternative form of function definition is an example of _point-free style_ where we don't specify the parameter (storing the number to be cubed and have 6 added) but instead define another function that will have that parameter.

The general rule for the functional composition operator `>>` is

`g(f(x))` is equivalent to `(f >> g) (x)`

We can also reverse the order of composition with the `<<` operator:

`g(f(x))` is equivalent to `(g << f) (x)`

The left-pointing composition operator often makes more intuitive sense to understand.
For example, we could create a test for evenness by combing the `isOdd` function defined above with Elm's [not](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Basics#not) function to negate it:

```elm {l raw siding}
isEven : Int -> Bool
isEven =
    not << isOdd


answer : Bool
answer =
    isEven 240
```

The `<<` operator is used commonly with elm-vegalite specifications to combine multiple channel encodings (see the [last chapter](elmIntroduction5.md) of this tutorial).
