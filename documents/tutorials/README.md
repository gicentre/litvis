# Literate Visualization Tutorials

This folder contains tutorials on creating litvis documents. Although all documents are markdown files, they are all written to be viewed within a litvis editor, so please make sure you have [installed a litvis plug-in](../../README.md) before reading them.

- **[writing your first litvis document](introduction/intro1.md)** is the place to start if you've not worked with litvis before.

- **[elmIntroduction](introducingElm/elmIntroduction1.md)** introduces the Elm language used for specifying visualizations in litvis.

- **[elmVegaliteWalkthrough](elmVegaliteWalkthrough/elmVegaliteWalkthrough1.md)** (and subsequent chapters) shows how visualizations may be specified and shows a range of chart types and interactions possible in a litvis document.

- **'geo' tutorials** show how geospatial data may be [specified](geoTutorials/geoFormats.md), [generated](geoTutorials/geoGenerating.md) and [imported](geoTutorials/geoImporting.md) in litvis documents.
