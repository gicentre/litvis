# Raw Elm output in LitVis documents

```elm {l}
askDeepThought question =
    if question == "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life" then
        42

    else
        0


answer =
    askDeepThought "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life"


answerAsString =
    "forty-two"
```

Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is ^^^elm r=answer^^^.

---

**^^^elm r=answer^^^ (^^^elm r=answerAsString^^^)** is the natural number that succeeds ^^^elm r=(answer-1)^^^ and precedes ^^^elm r=(answer+1)^^^. _[Wikipedia]_

> AK: `^^^elm r=answerAsString^^^` produces quotes. How about adding `^^^elm s=answerAsString^^^` for printing strings without quotes? Implementing this should be quicker than updating the docs.
>
> JWO: I think we can cover this with the `m`/`markdown` output, which should not generate quotes. This should work for all strings that do not contain markdown formatting instructions. For those that do, output of the literal with quotation marks makes sense.

^^^elm r=answer^^^ / $\pi$ = ^^^elm r=(answer / pi)^^^
