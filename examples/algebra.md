# Kindlmann and Scheidegger Visualization Algebra Schema Example

Uses a schema for considering the Kindlmann and Scheidegger (2014) algebra in visualization design. As a reminder, we consider the transformations between data (D) and visualization (V) through an intermediate stage of data representation on computer (R). _α_ represents some transform in data and _ω_ some transform in visualization.

In a good visualization design we would expect:

- a _correspondence_ between α and ω: as data varies in some way we would expect to see a corresponding variation in the visualization sufficient to infer how the data varies.
- that if α is the identity transform (i.e. no change in data), two different data representations should yield identical visualizations (therefore ω is also an identity transform).
- that if ω is the identity transform (i.e. two similar looking visualizations), this should only arise when α is also an identity transform (i.e. two similar data sources).

This can be summarised by saying that the paths from the D in the top left corner to the V in the bottom right should be equivalent either by traversing right then down _(r1 >> v >> ω)_ or down then right _(α >> r2 >> v )_. That is, the diagram is _commutative_.

- Failures in the invariance principle result in _hallicinators_ (unimportant change in R results in salient changes in V).

- Failures in the unambiguity principle result in _confusers_ (meaningful changes in D cannot be seen in V).

- Failures in the correspondence principle result in _jumblers_ (change in D does not result in an equivalent change in V) or _misleaders_ (change in V don't reflect equivalent change in D).

## Brexit Voting Map

We wish to construct a map of regional preferences in the 2016 UK referendum on leaving the EU ('Brexit'). Here is a candidate design:

^^^elm {v=(brexitMap Large NoChange BySize Desc)}^^^

Does it satisfy the principles of _invariance_, _unambiguity_ and _correspondence_?

## Principle of Representation Invariance

{( invariance |}

^^^elm {v=[(brexitMap Small NoChange ByLongitude Asc),(brexitMap Small NoChange ByLatitude Asc),(brexitMap Small NoChange BySize Asc),(brexitMap Small NoChange BySize Desc)]}^^^

{| invariance)}

{( invarianceAssessment |}

Varying the order in which data rows are plotted shows noticeable differences, especially in the London region. Therefore failing this principle introduces _hallucinators_. This is due to considerable overlap of the proportional circles.

## Principle of Unambiguous Data Depiction

{( unambiguity |}

^^^elm {v=[,(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 5) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 0) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy -5) BySize Desc)]}^^^

{| unambiguity )}

{( unambiguityAssessment |}

Systematic shifts by 5% of votes cast towards leave or remain are easily detectable where they affect the majority (shift between red and blue). Systematic shifts that don't cross the 50% boundary are also detectable, although less obvious. See for example size of blue circles in Scotland or red circles in Midlands/Northern England. Therefore, no evidence for _confusers_ in design.

## Principle of Visual-Data Correspondence

{( correspondence |}

^^^elm {v=[(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 0) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium Rand5pc BySize Desc)]}^^^

^^^elm {v=[(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy -5) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 0) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 5) BySize Desc)]}^^^

^^^elm {v=[(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 10) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 15) BySize Desc),(brexitMap Medium (LeaveBy 20) BySize Desc)]}^^^

{| correspondence )}

{( correspondenceAssessment |}

Adding a random 5% uniform random perturbation to the results (which is not a meaningful change in data) gives rise to a largely similar visualization.
Small changes are most easily detected where the shift crosses the 50% boundary, but this is not generally a problem as these are the smallest circles, having the smallest majorities.

As noted under _unambiguous data depiction_, systematic increases in either the remain or leave directions result in expected and detectable changes in size and colour.
Because of the problems with _hallucinators_ combined with ordering from largest to smallest majority, there are occasionally red/blue reordering such as the Brighton region between the 15% and 20% increase in leave examples.

Overall there is no evidence of any _jumblers_.
While not tested directly, there is no evidence to point towards _misleaders_ other than the re-ordering of two overlapping discs with similar majorities (size) but on opposite sides of leave-remain.
